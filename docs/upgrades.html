    <p style="text-align: left;line-height: 200%;">
        The computer we built this week is, quite frankly, not very powerful. At all. 
        Its process lacks any sort of computing power needed for any strenuos task, there is a complete lack of a dedicated GPU, and the RAM only runs at 2444 MHz.
        It is in desperate need of any sort of upgrade. Thankfully, this is a socket 1151 motherboard, and I am a huge computer nerd.
        I am one of the few to be able to say that I just have 1151 socket intel processors just lying around. I also just upgraded my personal computer's GPU.
        So, I will have plenty of spare parts, but I would recommend to any of my classmates to go for a higher end 1151 processor, such as a I7 or I9, and a secondhand 16 or 20 series NVidia GPU.
        Another requirement would be multiple more drives, running on only 120gb is nigh impossible with modern AAA games. 
        After some time, and before any more upgrades, a higher wattage power supply would be in order.
        In short, the upgrade potential is limitless, I could never say the half of what you could do. My only advise is do your research, and make educated purchases.
