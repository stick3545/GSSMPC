        <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">To understand what went into making these computers, first we have to understand what makes a computer, and what one needs.<br>
            To be considered a computer, an object needs four things:
            </p>
            <ul style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                <li>Memory,</li>
                <li>Processing,</li>
                <li>Input,</li>
                <li>Output.</li>
            </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
            These four things are the barebones of what makes up a conputer, all computers have them, and if it doesn't have all of them, it's not a computer.
            Computers obviously use more complicated components in order to do these tasks, such as the CPU, which handles the majority of the computer's logic and math. 
            CPUs are often touted as the "brain" of the computer (which, while acurate, is kinof a mute point, the entire computer is a brain. is it the brain's brain?).
            Memory, or RAM, standing for Random Accesss Memory. CPUs can only handle executing one line of code at a time. 
            RAM is a storage medium, same as any other drive, and although it is exceedingly fast, 
            it is also incredible volatile, in that it forgets everything it had stored when it loses power.
            GPUs, or graphical processesing units, are one of the most focused on parts of higher powered computers, people often think that having a good GPU is all one needs for a fast computer.
            They generate every image that is displayed on your monitor, all rendering that is done for animation and games, and mining cryptocurrency. 
            While those are all very large contributions, the GPU is not the only thing one needs to have a fast computer. 
            If the GPU far out performs the rest of the parts, then the parts hold back the GPU. 
            One of the parts needed for all of this, and for a powerful computer, is a good motherboard.
            Motherboards are what ties all the parts together, they are the platform all other parts use to connect to each other. 
            The speed and compatibility of certain parts, such as the CPU and GPU, are determined by the chipset and bandwidth of the corresponding motherboard socket.
